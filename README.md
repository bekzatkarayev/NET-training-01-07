#### Task 01
InsertNumber algorithm inserts bits of one 4 byte signed integer into another. Insertion is done by replacing bits from j-th to i-th position of source number with bits of other number. 
To achieve this, InsertNumber method first converts both numbers into binary strings, then builds new binary string bit by bit.
This string is converted to integer and returned as a result.
MSTest and NUnit unit tests are added.
